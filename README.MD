# Package Vue TS SFC with unbuild issue

I create this repo to reproduce a "bug" or bad implementation from myself.

I want to create a monorepo to share sfc component write in ts to our nexus. 

I try to do this with [unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) according to [antfu post](https://antfu.me/posts/publish-esm-and-cjs#bundleless-build).

## reproduce

1. download project
2. `pnpm install`
3. `pnpm build:lib -r`

You should see the error.

## Please help

If someone already do this and see where i miss something please help ðŸ¥º
